# movie_recommendation_sysyem
This is a content-based movie recommender system which is based on the similarity of content.
Project Flow->data->preprocessing->building model->creating website->deployment
Main aim to show 5 similar movies based on similarity of content
We will generate corpus(collection of tags) then we will convert text into vector(each movie will be a vextor) we will use Bag of Words text vectorization approach then we will apply stemming i.e Porter Stemmer
technique and we will find cosine distance and we will find distance of each movie with each and every movie.
